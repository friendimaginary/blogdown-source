# Biography

Patryk Soika is an Information Technology Specialist in Penn State University's
Earth and Environmental Systems Institute.  He does all the usual IT things, but
in his spare time he studies data science and R programming.  When ever
possible, he helps his colleagues with their research and tries to pass on what
he has learned.

He once calculated the set of integers mostly likely to win the lottery.
Unfortunately, they weren't significantly better than any other set.

His mid-life cricycle is basically a Vespa, but that doesn't mean he's doing it
wrong.
